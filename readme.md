# LPub4 #

LPub4 is a graphical tool for creation of ldraw models instructions. The original code was written by Kevin Clague and it's stored at [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpub4/).

Two main purposes of this repository are:
* to fix bugs of the original code
* to add linux specific part like scripts creating SW packages for linux distro's (openSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora)

There are three main branches:
* **upstream** - a mirror of the original CVS repository at sourceforge
* **master** - the development branch, it contains fixes of the code itself (no linux packaging)
* **packaging** - linux packaging part plus **master** branched merged there
